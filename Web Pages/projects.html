                  We have been provided with training data set of 7291 and 2007 test data of 16x16 grayscale handwritten images. 
                  We are instructed to either create our own algorithm or to use an already existing algorithm and modify it to increase the model's accuracy which will recognize the digits written on the images.
               </li>
            
               <li>
                  The algorithm we used to train our data is known as the Random Forest, a supervised machine-learning algorithm that is widely used in regression and classification problems. 
                  This algorithm uses an ensemble learning technique meaning it uses a collection of models (decision trees) to make the prediction, the majority vote or average from the decision trees outputs becomes the prediction.
